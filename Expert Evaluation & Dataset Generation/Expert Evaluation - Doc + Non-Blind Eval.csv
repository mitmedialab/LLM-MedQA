The two most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis is due to wear and tear of the joints and is more common in older patients. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks the joints. Both of these types of arthritis can be treated with anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy, and weight loss if necessary. If the pain is severe, you may also need to take pain medications.

Sometimes, a child has the normal bones and muscles, but one part of a bone is just too big or sticks out too far. Sometimes, a child is missing a muscle (or it's too small), and causes a bone to stick out or look like it sticks out. A bone that ""sticks out"" may also run in the family.","I'm sorry to hear that your daughter is having trouble with her scapula.
